When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all you 
work local?

  Whenever we want to backup our files into a central repository from where 
  they can be accessed from any other machines or by other contributors, we 
  choose a remote repository over a local one.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  We would always want to pull changes manually as we may be working on some
  changes that we don't want to get overridden with. We may want to first push
  those changes to the remote repository.
