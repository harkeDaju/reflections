When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all you 
work local?

  Whenever we want to backup our files into a central repository from where 
  they can be accessed from any other machines or by other contributors, we 
  choose a remote repository over a local one.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  We would always want to pull changes manually as we may be working on some
  changes that we don't want to get overridden with. We may want to first push
  those changes to the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

  Branches are new commits that have brached out of the main commit lines. We
  would use them whenever we want to make a different version from the main
  commit line. This way we can make changes to the new branch without
  affecting the main branch.

  Clones are copies of a repository. We clone a repository whenever we need a 
  copy of a repository to work on in our local environment.

  Forks are special commands of GitHub, which clones a repository from a 
  source account to a destination account in GitHub itself. We fork a
  repository when we don't have permission or don't want to push our changes 
  to that repository.
