How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Since, only the parts that were different wer shown, I was able scan for 
	changes much faster.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can easily find and revert the changes much faster.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Auto saving can end up making too many versions of the code. Unfinished 
	code can end up being committed. Manual committing prevents that. On the
	other hand, manual committing can make a commit too large and commits may
	not be logically grouped together.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows saving multiple files in one commit so to allow the programmer 
	to later find all the changes that were made when a particular feature was 
	created or when looking for changes to fix a bug. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    The command git log can be used to see the history of all the changes that
	have been made. 
	The command git diff can be used to find the difference between two commits.
	To escape both the commands, press 'q'.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    With version control there is an option of going back to the commit where 
	the program was working. So, even if a bug was introduced, you can go back
	to the version where the program worked and then also find the version where
	the program broke.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will be using Git for maintaining version control of my files. This 
	control will provide me with the freedom to change the content of the files
	without fear of losing the older stable versions.
